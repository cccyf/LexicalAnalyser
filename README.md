# LexicalAnalyser
:yum: A simple java lexical analyser.

I wrote this programme in November 2017:whale:. It was a assignment of one class. The professor offered us 2 choices in which this was the easier one. It was not really complicated, but it truly took me a while to think of what I had learned in the class and to apply that into coding. (Maybe I have missed lots of important informations about this lab...Next time I will listen more carefully I promise :dizzy_face:...) After I finished it, I thought maybe I should have try to write the hard one the Lex... It might be not that hard as I thought. 

If you are a student whose class requires you to write such a programme, or a person who is learning the dragon book, maybe you should challenge yourself and try to finish a Lex. If you are one of these people and you are trying to write your own lexical programmes, my suggestion for you is that understand the dragon book deeply and code carefully. 

Good luck!:ok_hand:
## Instructions
1. You can simply run the main.java and then you can get the analysed token sequences in the fie out.txt.
2. You can also rewrite the input.txt to make your own java file and get the result analysed by the programme.
